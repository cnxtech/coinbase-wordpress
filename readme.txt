This plugin has been deprecated and will no longer work after April 30th, 2018. This plugin previously allowed merchants to accept Bitcoin on your Wordpress-powered website with Coinbase legacy merchant tools.

Coinbase Commerce (https://commerce.coinbase.com) is a new merchant payment processor that allows you to accept multiple cryptocurrencies.
